This is a prototype to show how the media session HTML standards can be used to hijack track selection and play/pause for agree/disagree/pass actions.

The demo is most impressive when using a phone, and hitting play before turning off the device screen. The lock screen will be updated with:
- the current statement in the track title field
- the vote status and a countdown timer in the artist field
- a custom agree/disagree/pass image used for each of the registered votes

This shows how one could use the hardware buttons on any bluetooth device to agree/disagee/pass with statements spoken aloud or extracted from audio to show on phone lock screen.
